			<p>Hailing from northern Idaho and living in Portland Oregon currently, I know a thing or two about staying warm during the winter months. Instead of layered shirts or hoodies, I have always preferred to wear sweaters in the winter because they are super cozy, generally soft, and come in unique color patterns or knit sytles. My collection grows as I realize just how versatile sweaters are. I have chosen to highlught a few of my own sweaters and activities best suited to them. It is my hope that fellow sweater enthusiasts and prospective wearers will be inspired to make some great memories with a sweater of their own.
